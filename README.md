WIP hands-on lambda calculus tutorial

## Running the code

You will need Python >= 3.8

```
python3 -m untyped
```

This will put you into a repl. The repl currently only prints the parsed expression. It does not evaluate it. Part of the tutorial is to write the evaluation functions yourself and play around with it in the repl.

## TODO

- [ ] Comment snippets of code
- [ ] Write tutorial chapters
- [ ] Write exercises based on feedback from meeting
- [ ] Support STLC (and potentially other calculi like system F)
